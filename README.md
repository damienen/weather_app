This is a simple, one page app that can be used
in order to check the wather all around the globe!

## How to use it

The app is simple to use. 

You only have one page and you can't scroll. 
Everything is at a distance of one tap

As you can see in the photo, you have three buttons:

1) The magnifying glass: it is used in order to search for a new location's weather

2) The circular arrow. It is used in order to refresh the weather at your location

3) The letter (it can be either C or F). If you press it, you change between Celsius degrees and Fahrenheit degrees.
